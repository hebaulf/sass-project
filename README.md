# Sass Project - Module 3

In this project I decided to set up a page for some design components to make the best of Sass with the least anount of written code.

### To work on project

Clone project:
`git clone https://github.com/hebaulf/sass-project.git`

After cloning project run in terminal:
`npm install`

### Sass tools and aspects I used

- Gulp-sass to compile sass to css. (see: sass/\_variables.scss)
- File structure to break down elements for cleaner code.
- Nesting elements for clean code. (see: all .scss files)
- Variables for fonts and colors. (see: sass/\_variables.scss)
- Mixins for fluid font and flexbox. (see: sass/\_mixins.scss)
- A Function for stripping units from numbers to be used in the fluid font mixin. (see: sass/\_functions.scss)
